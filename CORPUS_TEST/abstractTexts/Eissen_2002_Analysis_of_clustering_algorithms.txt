 Automatic document categorization plays a key role in the development of future interfaces for Web-based search. Clustering algorithms are considered as a technology that is capable of mastering this “ad-hoc” categorization
task.
This paper presents results of a comprehensive analysis of clustering algorithms in connection with document categorization. The contributions relate to
exemplar-based, hierarchical, and density-based clustering algorithms. In particular, we contrast ideal and real clustering settings and present runtime results that
are based on efficient implementations of the investigated algorithms.
