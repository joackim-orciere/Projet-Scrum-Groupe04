AUTOMATIC LINGUISTIC SEGMENTATION OF CONVERSATIONAL SPEECH 
---------

As speech recognition moves toward more unconstrained domains
such as conversational speech, we encounter a need to be able to
segment (or resegment) waveforms and recognizer output into linguistically meaningful units, such a sentences. Toward this end,
we present a simple automatic segmenter of transcripts based on
N-gram language modeling. We also study the relevance of several word-level features for segmentation performance. Using only
word-level information, we achieve 85% recall and 70% precision
on linguistic boundary detection.1.
